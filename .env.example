# Repository Analyzer - Environment Variables
#
# This file documents environment variables that MAY be used with the Repository Analyzer.
# Currently, NO environment variables are required for normal operation.
#
# The analyzer is designed to work completely offline with no external dependencies,
# API keys, or secrets required.

# ==============================================================================
# OPTIONAL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ==============================================================================

# None currently used by the analyzer.
#
# The tool operates entirely from:
# 1. Configuration files (repo-analyzer.config.json)
# 2. Command-line arguments
# 3. Built-in defaults
#
# No secrets, API tokens, or credentials are needed.

# ==============================================================================
# FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
# ==============================================================================

# Currently, NO environment variables are used by the analyzer.
#
# If future versions add optional integrations (e.g., AI-powered insights,
# external security scanning), environment variables may be documented here.
# Any such additions will:
# - Be completely optional
# - Not affect core functionality
# - Be documented in the README and CHANGELOG
#
# The tool will continue to work completely offline with no environment
# variable configuration required for core features.

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES FOR AIR-GAPPED ENVIRONMENTS
# ==============================================================================

# The analyzer works perfectly in air-gapped environments with no special
# configuration. All features work without internet connectivity:
# - Language detection (built-in tables)
# - Dependency classification (built-in stdlib tables)
# - Structure parsing (built-in parsers)
# - File analysis (deterministic heuristics)

# ==============================================================================
# CI/CD INTEGRATION
# ==============================================================================

# The analyzer integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines without requiring
# any environment variable configuration. Standard configuration methods:
#
# 1. Use configuration file:
#    repo-analyzer scan --config ./my-config.json
#
# 2. Use command-line arguments:
#    repo-analyzer scan --output-dir ./reports
#
# 3. Use default configuration:
#    repo-analyzer scan

# For GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or other CI systems, simply:
# - Install the package
# - Run the command
# - No secrets or environment setup needed

# ==============================================================================
# DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
# ==============================================================================

# For development and testing, you may want to set:
# PYTHONPATH=.                       # Include current directory in Python path
# PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST=1              # Set by pytest automatically

# These are standard Python development variables and are not specific to
# the Repository Analyzer.

# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY
# ==============================================================================

# This tool does NOT require any secrets or credentials.
# DO NOT add sensitive information to this file or environment variables.
#
# If you need to secure your analysis outputs, use file system permissions
# and access controls, not environment variables.
